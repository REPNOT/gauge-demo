## Welcome Introduction

A [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) demonstration application for utilizing a custom Python module
that helps developers quickly incorporate [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) Gauge visualizations.
into their projects with the help of preset parameters. The application includes multiple
demonstrations and interactive examples to help users become familiar with the module code
which is available in the [documentation](https://plotly-stream-gauge.streamlit.app/Documentation) 
located at the bottom of the sidebar menu.  Additional information about the application, including
dependencies, tools used for development, and parameters, will be listed in the body of this page.

For anyone interested in exploring the application in greater detail, I invite you to begin the journey
by visiting the [Introduction Demo](https://plotly-stream-gauge.streamlit.app/Introduction_Demo),
where you'll find a series of widgets that simultaneously display and execute code being generated in each demo.  The modules included in the introduction assume that the viewer has experience calling functions in the [Python](https://www.python.org/) 
programming language. This is a newly created application that will continue to be updated. Links to my social
media profiles are located towards the bottom this page if you'd like to contact me.

With that being said, thank you for visiting and welcome! :smile:
